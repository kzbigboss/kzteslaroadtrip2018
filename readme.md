2017-01-01 thru 2017-01-05, my brother and I traveled from Chicago to Cupertino in a Tesla Model S P100D.  Along our route, I had an app running that pinged the Tesla API every minute so I could gather data and perform an analysis of our trip.  This repo documents our road trip experience while exposing the data/analyses made available from the resulting data.

To see my write up and analysis, head to the [kzteslaroaptrip](kzteslaroadtrip.md) page.

To see the data or the code used for manipulation, head to the [data](data/) folder.

To understand the Tesla API that was hit, check out [Tim Dorr's unofficial documentation](https://timdorr.docs.apiary.io/#).

For the app I modified, check out [DoctorMcKay's node-tesla-data report](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-tesla-data).
